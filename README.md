## ♨️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this Sudoku application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The project uses JavaFX, which is compatible with JDK versions 8 through 17. You can download the appropriate JDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/) or [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
- **JavaFX SDK**: If you are using JDK 11 or newer, you need to download the JavaFX SDK separately from [OpenJFX](https://openjfx.io/).

### Installation and Running the Application

Follow these steps to download and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/joonaMakiKorte/Sudoku.git
   ```
   This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```sh
   cd Sudoku
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   The project uses Maven as its build tool. To compile and package the application, run:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
   If you are on Windows, use:
   ```sh
   mvnw.cmd clean install
   ```
   This command will compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

4. **Run the Application**
   After building, execute the application using:
   ```sh
   java -jar target/Sudoku-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
   Ensure that the version number in the JAR file name matches the version specified in the `pom.xml` file.

### Troubleshooting

- **JavaFX Compatibility**: If you encounter errors related to JavaFX, make sure your JDK version includes JavaFX (JDK 8) or manually link the JavaFX SDK if using JDK 11+.
- **Maven Wrapper Execution**: If you have permission issues with `./mvnw`, give it execute permissions:
  ```sh
  chmod +x mvnw
  ```
  Alternatively, if you have Maven installed globally, use `mvn` instead of `./mvnw`.
- **Windows Users**: Use `mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw` and adjust file paths accordingly.

By following these instructions, you should be able to successfully run the Sudoku application. If you encounter issues, check the project's dependencies and environment setup.

Enjoy solving Sudoku with an intuitive and polished JavaFX experience! 🚀
